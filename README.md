# catch-analyzer
A machine learning application for analyzing posture in a rowing stroke. 

This repo just contains pre-trained models (`models/`) and supporting functions (`helpers.py`, `pipeline.py`) for running the application itself. For a demo and detailed description of the application, visit [this Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19qnezblA4nHW4ViMAbLsRJdCR8NUCwrK?usp=sharing) file. If you're interested in seeing the code used to process the data and train the model, see the "Further Reading" section of that Colab.
